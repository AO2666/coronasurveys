This folder contains the data collected in the surveys and the estimates we compute.

The most complete dataset is in the aggregate folder, where the raw data is aggregated. The data has not been post-processed, so it may contain outliers and other strange artifacts.

The folder PlotData contains the estimates we compute. This is work in progress, and hence the estimates may change over time (even old ones).
